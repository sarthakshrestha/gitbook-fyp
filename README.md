# 💻 Overview

## Incorporation of AI for detecting License Plates & Character Recognition

Artificial Intelligence encompasses Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Computer Vision belongs to a subset of Deep Learning. My final year project focuses on developing a License Plate Recognition system by integrating Artificial Intelligence.

#### Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of Computer Science that tries to imitate to how us Humans learn through processing of Data.

#### Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that learns from data and experience. Building a learning-based system is very essential for many kinds of generalized computer systems across many areas of computer system.

**Object detection through Deep Learning**

Object detection aims to identify objects that is present in an image or a video. It surrounds classifying image content by pinpointing objects.&#x20;

#### Roboflow's Role in labelling images and classifying characters for a license plate.

Roboflow played a huge significant role in faciliating my proejct as for labelin the image and character classification for license plates. It offers a lot of features such as dataset collection, annotation with multiple classes and training/validation and testing that helped to enhance the accuracy of license plate detection model.

## Collection of Dataset through Roboflow & GitHub

1. **Datasets Collection:** Datasets containing images of license plates were very crucial for training the AI model. Platforms like Roboflow, GitHub and specialized datasets assisted in providing annotating the images.
2. **Data Annotation:** Annotating the datasets with classes such as the numbers (0-9) and the character set of Devanagari characters was very essential for training the model to recognize license plates accurately.
3. **Training & Validation:** Training the AI model on a large number of annotated images which consisted of over 1000 photos were divided into training, validation and test that helped improve accuracy in license plate detection.
4. **Model Deployment:** Post-training, the model is ready for deployment for real-time previewing to demonstrate the functionality in recognizing license plates effectively.
