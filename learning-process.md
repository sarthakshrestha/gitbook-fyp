# Learning Process

Machine Learning

Learned the relevance of Computer Vision and Machine Learning through looking at courses, most specifically taught by Justin Johnson.&#x20;

Learned the importance of Tensors and how computers learn how an object is detected. I learned about Neural Networks and the importance of Computer Vision in this day and age.

Watched YouTube videos surrounding the field of Neural Networks. One of my key favorite was the Neural Network Chapters by 1Blue1Brown.

#### Deep learning with PyTorch

I had been currently learning PyTorch from a Udemy Course named 'Zero to Mastery : PyTorch for Deep Learning'&#x20;
