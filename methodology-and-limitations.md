# Methodology & Limitations

Utilizing the Scrum methodology has significantly contributed to the development of an AI-based license plate detection system, focusing on the specific goal of detecting and recognizing characters within an image. Scrum is a popular Agile framework that effectively manages the development process, emphasizing continuous improvement and testing throughout.



By breaking down the development process into manageable sprint sessions, Scrum allows for a more focused and productive approach. This methodology enabled me to concentrate on specific goals and tasks at hand, thereby increasing productivity and ensuring that each sprint's objectives were met effectively. One of the key benefits of using Scrum is its emphasis on addressing issues early in the development process. This approach helped reduce costs associated with fixing bugs and other issues, ensuring that the development process was efficient and cost-effective.&#x20;



In the case of this AI-based license plate detection system, the development was carried out with zero costs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Scrum methodology in managing resources and reducing development expenses. In summary, Scrum's iterative approach, continuous improvement, and early issue detection significantly contributed to the successful development of an AI-based license plate detection system. By breaking down the development process into manageable sprints, focusing on specific goals, and addressing issues early, Scrum proved to be a valuable tool in managing the development process effectively and efficiently.



#### Few Limitations exists within this product as well that can be delivered during further developments:&#x20;

The limitations of the AI-based license plate detection system include the inability to recognize embossed number plates using OCR due to the lack of NVIDIA's dGPU and CUDA cores on macOS machines. This issue can be addressed in future developments by implementing a different OCR technology that supports macOS or by providing a macOS version with NVIDIA's dGPU and CUDA cores. Additionally, the current system is not designed for video capturing systems where license plates are captured and saved within a system in real-time. To overcome this limitation, the system can be enhanced with video processing capabilities, enabling real-time license plate detection and recognition from video feeds. This feature can be particularly useful in surveillance and traffic management applications.&#x20;



The AI-based license plate detection system can be further improved by addressing the limitations of OCR for embossed number plates and real-time video capturing and processing. These enhancements can expand the system's capabilities and make it more versatile for various applications.
