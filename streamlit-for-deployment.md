# Streamlit for Deployment

The post models were put into Streamlit which is a Python Framework that helps in deploying and showcasing ML technologies. For this instance I have utilized it for creating the AI based license plate detection system.&#x20;

After running locally on the machine, it can be used both on mobile and the web as well.

The model will then be officially deployed on Streamlit's official deployment web app.
